# cppLargestOfThree
Largest of Three Ints Program
## C++ GitHub Assignment

Create a C++ program which gets three integers from the user and finds the sum and largest of the three integers.

Output the sum of the ints and the largest of the ints to the standard output device.

Examine the approved solution I coded up and the ChatGPT solution. Try to write this program on your own and list your references because 
you will be using the code in this program for other things.

The due date is Feb 26, but complete this assignment as soon as possible because we must move on to the midterm program soon.

Comments from ChatGPT:
In this program, we declare three integer variables to hold the user input, and two additional integer variables to store the total and largest values.

We prompt the user to enter three integers using cout and cin, and then calculate the total by adding the three integers.

To find the largest of the three integers, we use nested if statements to compare each number to the other two, and update the value of largest accordingly.

Finally, we output the total and largest values using cout.
